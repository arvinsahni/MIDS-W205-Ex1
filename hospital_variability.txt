In order to find answer to this query , I have used both effective care and readmissions data as they both fall under procedures data.I combine the two tables with a UNION ALL and use the built-in function stddev_pop against the score column to identify the top 10 .
While the data from readmissions table is picked up without any additional filtering , i filter out the non-numeric scores in the effective care table as highlighted for the previous questions
