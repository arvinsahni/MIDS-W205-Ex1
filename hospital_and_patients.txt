Part 3 : Q4
Correlation between hospital quality score or procedural variability score with survey responses

Correlation between hospital quality score and survey responses = -12.1% ( negative 12.1%)


From the CMS Hospital compare website:
“The Patient Experience of Care Domain score is comprised of two parts: the HCAHPS Base Score (maximum of 80 points) and the HCAHPS Consistency Score (maximum of 20 points)…… The Patient Experience of Care Domain Score (0 – 100 points) is the sum of the HCAHPS Base Score (0 – 80 points) and HCAHPS Consistency Score (0 – 20 points). “
Hence I use the sum of these two as a factor of determining correlation against the hospital quality score ( determined as part of the best_hospitals question)

As measures and its related variability do not appear in the survey_responses table directly , I am not focussing on this for correlation calculation
